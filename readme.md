# Passive Warrior HLAs

The warrior's role in AD&D combat was much more passive than it is in modern RPGs.  For the most part, you would choose a target and attack; unique abilities were left to the spellcasters.

The High Level Abilities (HLAs) introduced by Throne of Bhaal add complexity and micromanagement antithetical to the role of warriors, characters who have remained relatively passive participants in combat for the majority of 2 games.

This mod aims to reduce this added complexity by reworking the majority of activated warrior HLAs into passive bonuses.

## Whirlwind Attack

Provides a permanent +1 attack per round.

## Greater Whirlwind Attack

Provides an additional permanent +1 attack per round.

*Requires: Whirlwind Attack*

## Deathblow

Critical Hits automatically slay enemies level 12 or below.

## Greater Deathblow

## Hardiness

Permanently increases all Physical Resistances by 5%.

## Resist Magic

Permanently increases Magic Resistance by 5%.

May be taken up to 10 times in total.

## Power Attack

Permanently increases all attack damage +5.

## Critical Strike

Increases Critical Range by 1 (if you would crit on 20, now crit on 19-20).  Also eliminates possibility of Critical Misses on attack rolls of 1.

*Requires: Power Attack*

## Smite

Critical Hits stun foes for 1 round.

*Requires: Power Attack, Critical Strike*

## War Cry

For 1 round per 2 levels of the warrior, all allies in a 15-ft. radius gain increased movement speed and +2 bonuses to hit rolls, damage rolls, and AC.

*NB: Obviously this is not a passive bonus.  This is intended to be used alongside other pre-buffs so the warrior does not have to worry about activating it in the midst of battle.*
